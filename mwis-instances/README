This is a collection of maximum weighted independent set (MWIS)
instances as they arise during the computation of the fractional
coloring number. See also:

For most instances they represent the last MWIS instance that needs to
be solved, which is often the running time bottleneck.  For some
instances column generation did not terminate and the instance refers
to any intermediate MWIS instance, but not necessarily the final one.
These instances have a number in their name between '.mwis.' ('.mwclq' resp.) 
 and '.dimacs'.

The directory mwis contains the original MWIS problems, while mwclq
contains equivalent maximum weighted clique problems in the complement
graphs.

The scalef comment in each file is a threshold value.  In the column
generation for computing the fractional coloring number, only stable
sets heavier than scalef can improve the primal LP value.  'scalef' is
the scaled representation of 1.0 in the original MWIS problem.

For the purpose of coloring, one need not necessarily find the MWIS.
Instead, it suffices to decide whether the weight of a MWIS is larger
than scalef and, if so, return any stable such heavier than scalef.
